This module can be installed on perl5.8 if you add Net::DNS.

It was not tested on older versions but it might work.

The module itself is pure perl, so if the prerequisites are
fullfilled no C-Compiler is necessary.

For installation do the usual

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
